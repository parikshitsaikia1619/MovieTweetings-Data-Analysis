## Project Motivation
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is a capstone project of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I used MovieTweetings Dataset for this project. MovieTweetings is a dataset consisting of ratings on movies that were contained in well-structured tweets on Twitter. This dataset is the result of research conducted by Simon Dooms.<br>
Dataset: https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings
<br>
<br>
This project focuses on answering following questions: 
* What are the top 10 highest rated movies in twitter?
* What are the top 10 most reviewed movies on twitter?
* Which twitter users are potential candidates to get hired from a movie reviewing company?
* Which genres are popular for movies?
<br>
<br>

I am using python 3.6 in Jupyter Notebook.
* Numpy
* Pandas
